# Root Locus (Graphical Tool) 

This is a fun little weekend project I worked on for my *Modern Control* class. 

It is a python implementation of the Root Locus Design Method. The RL plots the location of the roots of the characteristic equation of the closed-loop transfer function as the gain K is varied from 0 to infinity. 

## Requirements

- Python 2+, 3+
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn (optional)
